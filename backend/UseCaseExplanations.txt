1. Credit Default Prediction
Simulate whether a customer starting in state G (Good) is likely to move into F (Default) within 6 or 12 months.

2. Portfolio Risk Analysis
Upload a file of 1000 customers. Run simulation. Instantly see how many will likely default. Used by risk analysts.

3. Loan Approval Strategy
Use the API to test if a "D" state customer is too risky. If many D-state customers end in F â†’ deny or increase interest.

4. Data Science Preprocessing
Use simulation outputs to generate training labels (e.g., finalState) for machine learning fraud or credit scoring models.

5. Report Automation
Hook into a weekly process: upload current loan customer states, simulate 6-month forecast, output dashboard & CSV.
